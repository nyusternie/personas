# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Personas?
Personas are Personal Finance AI Assistants designed to grow and adapt to your busy digital lifestyle. We're revolutionizing how users interact with Bitcoin Cash by solving its biggest challenges: complexity and security.

### How does Personas differ from traditional wallets?
Unlike traditional crypto wallets that require seed phrases and technical knowledge, Personas uses:
- **AI-powered natural language commands**
- **Passkey authentication** (no seed phrases)
- **Gasless transactions** for token transfers
- **Social recovery** mechanisms

### Is Personas free to use?
Yes, the basic Personas wallet is free to use. Some advanced features may have associated fees, which will be clearly communicated.

## Technical Questions

### How do gasless transactions work?
Personas uses Account Abstraction and a Paymaster system that handles miner fees on your behalf. This means you can transact with CashTokens without needing to hold native BCH for gas fees.

### What blockchain does Personas support?
Personas is built for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem, supporting BCH and all CashTokens.

### How secure are passkeys compared to seed phrases?
Passkeys are more secure than seed phrases because:
- They're phishing-resistant
- Private keys never leave your device
- They use biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID)
- No risk of seed phrase loss or theft

## Support Questions

### How do I recover my account if I lose my device?
Personas uses social recovery. You'll need approval from your designated trusted contacts to recover your account on a new device.
